### Hi there, I'm Red ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer with many years of experience. At the moment I am diving deep into Typescript, React, Rust and Elixir, and I love getting my hands dirty in coding puzzles (tech interviewers better be prepared ðŸ¤£). But I have experience in a lot of other languages and technologies like Go, Dart, Python and PHP. I already did a lot in my live, from being a banker, playing music on tour, jumping out of planes, being a music composer, to being a freelance web developer, and designing t-shirts.

- **Î»** I prefer FP over OOP, but whatever gets the job done.

- ðŸŒ± Vegan
