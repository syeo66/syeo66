### Hi there, I'm Red ðŸ‘‹

Yeah, this is really my name. I'm a Senior Frontend Developer, and I code. At the moment I am diving deep into Typescript and React. But I have experience in a lot of other languages and technologies like Go, Dart, Python and PHP. I already did a lot in my live, from being a banker, to work as music composer, to being a freelance web developer, and designing t-shirts.

- ðŸš€ In love with rockets and space  
- **Î»** I prefer FP over OOP, but whatever gets the job done.
- ðŸŒ± Vegan

#### Some stuff I did ðŸ”­

- https://shuffle.raven.ch/ - Log in with your Spotify account, select the playlists to pick songs from, click 'Shuffle' to start playing a random selection.
