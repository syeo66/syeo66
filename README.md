### Hi there, I'm Red ðŸ‘‹

Yeah, this is really my name. I'm the Head of (Software) Development at Mindfire, and I code. Currently I really like Typescript, Go and Dart. But I have experience in a lot of other languages and technologies. I already did a lot in my live, from being a banker, to work as music composer, to being a freelance web developer, and designing t-shirts.

- ðŸš€ In love with rockets and space  
- **Î»** I prefer FP over OOP, but whatever gets the job done.
- ðŸŒ± Vegan
